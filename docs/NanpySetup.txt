Quick Setup Guide for Nanpy on RaspPi
By Antony Nguyen

Install Nanpy onto Arduino

1. Go to Downloads directory.

2. git clone https:/github.com/nanpy/nanpy-firmware

3. cd into nanpy-firmware and run ./configure.sh to create
   configuration file in Nanpy folder.

4. cd into Nanpy and use a text editor to edit cfg.h
   The header file will determine which parts you would like to use
   For this project, change the setting for USE_Servo from 0 to 1
   because we will be using a servo.

5. Copy nanpy-firmware into the Arduino libraries folder using the command
   cp -avr nanpy-firmware/ ~/sketchbook/libraries/

6. Open up Arduino IDE and upload Nanpy onto Arduino. You can ignore any
   error messages that says name uses improper characters.

7. Go to File > Sketchbook > Libraries > nanpy-firmware > Nanpy
   Connect Arduino, compile and upload

Install Arduino onto Raspberry Pi / PC

1. Go to Downloads directory

2. git clone https:/github.com/nanpy/nanpy

3. cd into nanpy folder

4. If using python 3
   sudo python3 setup.py install
   If using python 2.7
   sudo python setup.py install
   For this project we will be using python3
